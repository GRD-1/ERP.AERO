# The demo project
This is the test Node.js project. It was created to demonstrate my base skills in Node.js coding.

* This project has no user interface. All tests are supposed to be performed using Swagger UI or Postman

* To simplify testing, I added an API map to the project. It is avalible on localhost:3000/api

* For the same reason I didn't clear the test database and local file storage: /server/public/uploads

* To simplify deloyment, I didn't exclude the config file from the repository. It is here: /server/config

* The database is MySQL. Dump file is here: /database_dump

* The connection parameters are already signed in the config file (/server/config). Just restore the base and run the server!
